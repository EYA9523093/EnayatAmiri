        <h2>About</h2>
        <p align="justify">
         I was born in 1998 in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Iran. I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in 
          Communication Engineering, from <a href="https://english.iut.ac.ir/">Isfahan University of Technology</a> in 2021. During this time, I broadened
          my knowledge of Medical Engineering and communication systems. Building on this foundation, I pursued my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on 
          Control Engineering at the <a href="https://www.sharif.ir/">Sharif University of Technology</a>. Under 
          the supervision of <a href="http://ee.sharif.edu/~haeri/">Prof. Mohammad Haeri</a>, my research centers on scheduling traffic lights
          using secure computation. I successfully completed my degree in 2024. Throughout my master’s studies, I enhanced both my research background 
          and soft skills, working on traffic systems and employing cryptographic techniques
          to secure traffic signals.
        <br>
        Over the course of my academic journey, I authored two research papers: one presented at the <a href="https://iceeconf.ir/2023/en">International Convergence of Electrical Engineering (ICEE)</a> conference and another published in
          the Journal of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979">IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</a>, reflecting my growing expertise and contributions in the field. I currently serve as a researcher
          in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology. My primary research interests include transportation
          systems, cyber-physical systems, model predictive control, and multi-agent systems. Through my work, I aim to advance innovative solutions 
          that bridge the gap between theoretical control concepts and their real-world applications in intelligent transportation and beyond.
